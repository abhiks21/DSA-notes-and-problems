# DSA Topic Priority for Big Tech Interviews

This priority list is based on the frequency and importance of topics commonly asked in interviews at major tech companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and others.

---

## ðŸ”¥ Top Priority (Most Commonly Asked)
1. **Arrays & Strings**  
   - Fundamental data structures
   - Sliding window, two pointers, sorting, searching

2. **Linked Lists**  
   - Singly, doubly linked lists
   - Cycle detection, reversal, merging

3. **Trees & Binary Trees**  
   - Traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder)
   - Binary Search Trees (BST)
   - Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA), height, diameter

4. **Graphs**  
   - Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   - Basic shortest path problems (BFS-based)

5. **Recursion & Backtracking**  
   - Subsets, permutations, combinations
   - Classic backtracking problems

6. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**  
   - Recursion with memoization (top-down DP)
   - Key patterns like 0/1 Knapsack, Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS), Subset Sum

## âš¡ Medium Priority (Frequently Asked but Slightly Advanced)
7. **Heaps & Priority Queues**  
   - Min heap, max heap applications
   - Kth largest/smallest problems

8. **Binary Search & Divide and Conquer**  
   - Classic binary search and its variations
   - Merge sort, quick sort concepts

9. **Greedy Algorithms**  
   - Interval scheduling, activity selection
   - Huffman coding basics

10. **Trie**  
    - Prefix trees for string manipulation
    - Autocomplete, word search problems

11. **Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)**  
    - Cycle detection in graphs
    - Connected components

---

## ðŸš€ Lower Priority (Less Frequent, Advanced Topics)
12. **Segment Trees & Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees)**  
    - Range queries and updates

13. **Bit Manipulation**  
    - Bitwise operations, masks

14. **Advanced DP**  
    - DP on trees, bitmask DP

15. **Mathematical Algorithms**  
    - Number theory, combinatorics

> **Note:**  
> Master the top priority topics thoroughly before moving on to medium and advanced topics. This approach aligns with the focus of most big tech interviews.
